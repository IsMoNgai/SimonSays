This is the code for the game SimonSays. It is powered with arduino. If you have the required components you can build it in real life.
Try set it up in tinkercad and play with it.
Basically the rules are:

how the game works?
once you lost tracking the red light will blink and u lose game restart.
once u track all the light in a round green light will blank and u win then game restart.
