#SimonSays
This is the code for the game SimonSays. It is powered by Arduino. If you have the required components you can build it in real life.
Try to set it up in Tinkercad and play with it.
Basically, the rules are:

how does the game work?
once you lose tracking the red light will blink and you lose the game restart.
once you track all the lights in a round green light will blank and you win then the game restart.
